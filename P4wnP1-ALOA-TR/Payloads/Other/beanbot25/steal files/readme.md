Hello thanks for using my P4wnP1 scripts
This is used from seytonics video, which has been improved a little bit

But before you can use this in your P4wnP1 you need to run a few commands:


===================================


download, install and open puTTY

connect to your p4wnp1 wifi

connect to 172.24.0.1

username:root

psk:toor

	cd P4wnP1/dist/helper
	./genimg -i -s 1000 -o 1gb -l recovery
	
Wait a miunte until genimg finishes then continue

Open the P4wnP1 dashboard by going to your browser and entering 172.24.0.1:8000
